<h2>SWC plus (SWC+) format specification document</h2>
<p>
Reconstructed neuron morphologies play a very important role in 
the data exchange between neurophysiology labs and the general 
neuroscience community. The currently used data formats however are not good
at maximizing the knowledge that can be extracted from the data.
On the one hand there are closed source formats that have been developed
over the years to support the ever expanding featureset of commercial
tracing software that is often directly attached to the microscope setup.
The most popular format being <tt>Neurolucida</tt> (MicroBrightField Inc.) in 
various incarnations. The schema behind these formats has been 
reverse-engineered to some extent, but remains elusive.
On the other side of the spectrum is the very simple <tt>SWC</tt> format (Cannon, 1998), 
that was designed to store trees as cylindrical segments to form the basis of 
compartmental models. The conversion from the commercial, feature-rich
formats to <tt>SWC</tt> comes with a big loss of information, for example all
lines, markers or contours that mark features of the neuron and its 
position in the tissue are lost.
</p><p>
What all formats lack is a standard way to describe such features,
there is no standard way to label the border between layer 1 and 2.
"layer 1/2", "Layer 1", "border between layer 1 and 2"?
This is the motivation to introduce a new format called SWC+. As the name
suggests it is derived from <tt>SWC</tt>. It does however allow lines,
contours, markers and even images and surfaces to be embedded, and comes
with an extensible Predefined Types Library that promotes standard ways 
to store information about neurons.
</p>
<h3>An SWC-compatible format with Extensible Types</h3>
<p>
SWC plus (<tt>SWC+</tt>) is an open source (<a href="https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/SWCplus">github</a>) format for storing neuron 
morphologies. It is both forward and backward compatible with the 
standardized SWC format used by NeuroMorpho.org, but has extended type 
definitions that allow for storage of a variety of geometric primitives
such as contours and markers, which are often present in Neurolucida source files. 
Since <tt>SWC+</tt> is compatible with <tt>SWC</tt>, the file extension remains <tt>.swc</tt>. 
Forward compatibility implies that older software can read trees from <tt>SWC+</tt>, while backward 
compatibility means that parsers for <tt>SWC+</tt> can also parse <tt>SWC</tt>.
</p>
<h3>Specification of standard SWC</h3>
<p>
(Adapted from: <a href="http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html">Neuronland SWC specification</a>)<br/>
An <tt>SWC</tt> file is a text file that starts with a comment section,
in which each line starts with the symbol #.
Below the comments, a numeric matrix with 7 columns follows.
The seven numbers in each row are separated by spaces.
</p><p>
The seven columns have the following meaning:
<ol><li>
<tt>SampleID</tt> : Sample identifier. A positive integer.
</li><li>
<tt>StructureID</tt> : Structure identifier. The basic set of structures used
in NeuroMorpho.org <tt>SWC</tt> files is:
<pre>
-1  - root
 0  - undefined
 1  - soma
 2  - axon
 3  - dendrite (=basal dendrite)
 4  - apical   (=apical dendrite)
 5+ - custom
</pre>
In addition, some databases use the following structures 5 and 6:
<pre>
5 - branch point (sometimes used for file parsing efficiency, branch 
    points are otherwise defined as points that have multiple children)
6 - end point (leaf)
</pre>
</li><li>
<tt>x</tt> : X-position in micrometers
</li><li>
<tt>y</tt> : Y-position in micrometers
</li><li>
<tt>z</tt> : Z-position in micrometers
</li><li>
<tt>r</tt> : Radius in micrometers (half the cylinder thickness)
</li><li>
<tt>ParentID</tt> : Parent sample identifier. This defines how points are 
connected to each other. In a tree, multiple points can have the same
ParentID. The first point in the file must have <pre>ParentID = -1</pre>.
Parent samples must be defined before they are being referred
to. By counting how many points refer to the a given parent, the number 
of its children can be computed.
</li></ol>
</p><p>
<h3>Specification of the SWC+ extensions</h3>
For new software to recognize the extended features of <tt>SWC+</tt> files,
an <tt>SWC+</tt> file must start with the following 
comment-line:
<pre># SWC+ version 1.0</pre>
where 1.0 refers to the <tt>SWC+</tt> version used (see <a href="#versioning">versioning</a>).
</p><p>
<tt>SWC+</tt> redefines the <tt>StructureID</tt> as a <tt>TypeID</tt> that links to an extensible
Type Library that is partly predefined and partly user defined.
Members 0 to 4 of the Type Library correspond to the standard
<tt>SWC</tt> structure list (see above). Members 5 to 15 are undefined, because 
they may be in use by various custom <tt>SWC</tt> files. Members 16-255 are 
reserved for predefined types that are part of the <tt>SWC+</tt> standard, and 
members 256-65535 are reserved for user defined types.
</p><p>An <tt>SWC+</tt> Type not only encodes for a Structure, but also for the 
geometric primitive that is used to represent the structure.
The following geometric primitives are defined (* means required attribute, defaults between brackets):
<dl>
<dt>tree</dt><dd>tree of connected points <tt>(x,y,z)</tt> with radius <tt>r</tt> 
  as used in standard <tt>SWC</tt> files</dd>
<dt>contour</dt><dd>equivalent to NeuroLucida's contour, often used for 
  tracing the cell body, or for tracing borders between cortical layers. 
  <tt>r</tt> represents the wall thickness of the contour in micrometers.<br/>
  Custom attributes: closed ("false"), fill ("none")</dd>
<dt>marker</dt><dd>point marker located at <tt>(x,y,z)</tt>. <tt>r</tt> 
  represents the marker size in micrometers.<br/> 
  Custom attributes: symbol ("o")</dd>
<dt>image</dt><dd>image anchor. The image is treated as a volume with
  only a single point in the <tt>y</tt>-dimension. Coordinate 
  transformations are the same as for the volume anchor.<br/>
  Custom attributes: src*</dd>
<dt>volume</dt><dd>volume anchor. If the volume is referred to by a 
  single point, then <tt>(x,y,z)</tt> is used to translate the volume, 
  and <tt>r</tt> to scale the volume. If the volume is referred 
  to by a chain of four points, then the <tt>(x,y,z,r)</tt> of these 
  four points are used as columns of a 4x4 transformation matrix that is
  to be applied to the volume.<br/>
  Custom attributes: src*</dd>
<dt>surface</dt><dd>surface anchor. Vertices and faces are specified in
  the file referenced by the <tt>src</tt>-attribute. Coordinate 
  transformations of vertices are the same as for the volume anchor.<br/>
  Custom attributes: src*</dd>
</dl>
A formal description of these geometric primitives is provided as an <a href="https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/SWCplus/ExtendedTypes.xsd">XML schema</a>.
<p>Types are specified in <tt>XML</tt>, in which one of the geometric primitives 
is used as the <tt>XML</tt>-tag for a given type. All primitives have required attributes
<tt>id</tt> (the TypeID), <tt>key</tt> (short name),  <tt>name</tt> and
<tt>parent</tt> plus optional attribute <tt>color</tt>. 
On top of that come the custom attributes listed above, and finally a
comment can be specified in the text between the opening and closing tag 
of the type. See the example below. The <tt>parent</tt> attribute provides
a grouping of types into a hierarchy, used to orderly display the contents
of the SWC+ file. The attributes <tt>color</tt>, <tt>fill</tt> and <tt>symbol</tt> 
are suggested style attributes. Their value may be overruled by the <tt>SWC+</tt> renderer.
<pre>
&lt;ExtendedTypes>
  &lt;tree id="0" key="root" name="root node">Root node&lt;/tree>>
  &lt;tree id="1" key="soma" parent="root" name="soma" color="#0D0">Soma (=cell body)&lt;/tree>
  &lt;tree id="2" key="axon" parent="root" name="axon" color="#00F">Axon&lt;/tree>
  &lt;tree id="3" key="dendrite" parent="root" name="(basal) dendrite" color="#F00">(basal) Dendrite&lt;/tree>
  &lt;tree id="4" key="apical" parent="root" name="apical dendrite" color="#800">Apical dendrite&lt;/tree>
  &lt;marker id="16" key="soma-center" parent="soma" name="soma (center point)"/>
  &lt;contour id="17" key="soma-contour" parent="soma" name="soma (contour)" closed="true"/>
  &lt;surface id="18" key="soma-surface" parent="soma" name="soma (surface)" src="soma.obj"/>
  &lt;volume id="19" key="soma-volume" parent="soma" name="soma (volume)" src="soma.nrrd"/>
  etc. etc.
&lt;/ExtendedTypes>
</pre>
The complete predefined type library is <a href="https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/SWCplus/ExtendedTypes.html">available here</a>.
</p><p>
User defined types are defined in the same <tt>XML</tt> format as predefined 
types. Each line is preceded by a # and placed in the comment section of
the <tt>SWC</tt> file. For example:
<pre>
# &lt;ExtendedTypes>
#   &lt;marker id="256" key="gapjunction" name="gap junction" parent="axon" symbol="G"/>
# &lt;/ExtendedTypes>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Backward and forward compatibility with SWC</h3>
<p>
In standard <tt>SWC</tt>, all points belong to the <tt>tree</tt> geometric primitive
and have a <tt>StructureID</tt> that refers to the neurite type of the given branch.
In <tt>SWC+</tt>, the <tt>StructureID</tt> is replaced by a <tt>TypeID</tt>,
but for the types supported by standard <tt>SWC</tt>, the <tt>StructureID</tt>
and <tt>TypeID</tt> are equivalent. For the newly defined types, with
<tt>TypeID</tt> 16 and up, it is expected that existing software will recognize these as
unknown structures and will not treat them as part of any neurite tree.
</p>

<h3>Linear segments and type specifications in SWC and SWC+</h3>
<p>
In both <tt>SWC</tt> and <tt>SWC+</tt>, every point in the 7-column matrix
has a <tt>TypeID</tt>. This is often redundant, since for example all
points in an axonal tree have the same type. In general, for every linear 
(non-branching) segment of a tree, the type of the first point in that
segment is sufficient to specify its type. 
<tt>SWC+</tt> specifies that the first point of a segment defines its type.
Consecutive points may have the same <tt>TypeID</tt> (recommended), 
or 0, 5 or 6 (for compatibility; 5 and 6 indicate "branch point" and 
"end point" in some <tt>SWC</tt> variants). Any other value indicates 
the start of a new segment, even if no branching occurs. If branching 
does occur, a segment still continues if all but one of the branches
are pseudo-branches. Pseudo branches are branches that do not use
the same geometric primitive as the parent segment. It is tempting to 
use the redundant type specifications to mark certain parts of a segment 
with a label like 'bouton' or 'varicosity'. Doing so would however break
compatibility with <tt>SWC</tt>. Such labels can instead be attached to a
segment as separate points using pseudo branches with geometric primitive <tt>marker</tt>.
</p>

<a name="versioning"></a>
<h3>SWC+ versioning</h3>
<p>
The first line of an <tt>SWC+</tt> file must be formatted as
<pre># SWC+ version X.Y</pre> where X is the major and Y the minor 
version number. The major version determines the Type Library to be used.
Software that reads <tt>SWC+</tt> files must use ExtendedTypes_vX.xml
for major version number X. The full url for version 0 is <a href="https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/SWCplus/ExtendedTypes_v0.xml">https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/SWCplus/ExtendedTypes_v0.xml</a>.
Inside the <tt>ExtendedTypes_v0.xml</tt> file, the root XML element has
a <tt>version</tt> attribute that contains the full version number.
If an <tt>SWC+</tt>-reader has a Type Library with a full version number
lower than that of the <tt>SWC+</tt> file it tries to read, then it needs
to update its Type Library.

<p><h3>Release notes</h3>
<tt>SWC+</tt> is currently under construction, the latest version 
is 0.1.
</p>
<h3>SWC+ implementation</h3>
<p>
The SWC+ standard is originally developed as an export format for the
<a href="https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/morphology-viewer/">HBP Morphology viewer</a>, 
which can import and repair SWC files with certain quirks and export to SWC+, see
<a href="HBP_implementation.html">this document</a> for implementation details.
